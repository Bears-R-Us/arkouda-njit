"""Breadth-First Search Benchmark

This script provides a benchmark on a graph built in Arachne from two Arkouda arrays. The graphs are 
randomly generated by using the ak.randint function with the range of the vertex names being picked 
from [0,n-1] and the number of edges m. No special distribution is used to generated the graph. 

The values of n and m are accepted from command line input. As well as the number of trials for
executing breadth-first search.

Assumes Arkouda server is running. It will shutdown the Arkouda server upon completion.

Sample usage: python3 breadth_first_search.py n1 5555 5000 20000 5
