    This is the double index graph data structure based graph representation. The graph data resides

    Graphs hold undirected edges. Self loops and multiple edges are not allowed.

    Nodes currently are only allowed to be integers. They may contain optional key/value attributes.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes. They may contain optinal key/value attributes. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_vertices : int
        The number of vertices in the graph. 
    n_edges : int
        The number of edges in the graph.
    directed : int
        The graph is directed (True) or undirected (False).
    weighted : int
        The graph is weighted (True) or unweighted (False).
    name : string
        The name of the graph in the backend Chapel server.
